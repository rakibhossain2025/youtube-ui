# 📺 SimpleTube — YouTube’r ছেলে!

> Built with ⚛️ React + ❤️ Love + 3 Cups of ☕ Coffee

---

## 🤔 What is this?

A simple, fake YouTube UI made by a developer who watches more videos than he writes code.  
This site lets you **pretend** you're productive while actually browsing cats doing parkour 🐱💨.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (Because Vanilla JS felt too healthy)
- Tailwind CSS (Because writing CSS is pain 🥲)
- Love, hope, and delayed sleep 💤

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🔍 Search bar that does nothing (yet looks important)
- 🧠 Suggestion sidebar — to make you feel like a pro dev
- 💥 No backend, no database, no rules!

---

## 🤓 How to run

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/rakibhossain2025/youtube-ui)
cd youtube-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then...
👉 Sit back.
👉 Open browser.
👉 Pretend you built YouTube. 😎

🐛 Known Issues
Videos won’t play — because they’re images 🙃
The search bar won’t search — but it looks serious
May cause overconfidence in beginners (side effect)

🚀 Future Plans
Add "404 Not Found" page for no reason
Build an AI that watches videos for you
Add dark mode for 0.0001% productivity boost

🤝 Contribute

🧠 Inspiration
“Why build the next big thing when you can build a fake YouTube?”
